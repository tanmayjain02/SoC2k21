***Project : Facial Recognition App***

Mentor : Prayas Jain, Vanshika Gupta

**Checkpoint 1 : 11 April 2021**

1) **Task 1 : A1**

This task consits of Python Library Pandas exercises, which extract information from a dataset.

 2) **Task 2 : A2**

 This task consits of Python Library Matplotlib exercises, in this task we plot different graphsand histograms from the information extracted from dataset.  
 
 **Checkpoint 2 : 8 June 2021**
 
 3) **Task 4 : B3**
 
 In this task we used OpenCV to find the Gender and Age of the person using webcam feed.

 4) **Task 5: B4**
                    
 This task is also simmilar to task 4, but intead of webcame feed we provide a YouTube video.
 
 **Checkpoint 3 : 18 July 2021**
 
 5) **Task 6: C1**
 
 This task consists of building an android project, which can tell the age and gender of the face detected using the camera.

 6) **Task 7: C2**
                     
 This task is the implementatin of all above tasks to build a ML Model in which we train to it recongise faces.
 We provide a feed of same face to train the model, after which the model can detect the faces and cluster the similar faces together.
